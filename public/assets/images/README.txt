Default Logo Creation Instructions:

To create a default logo.png file:

1. Create a simple PNG logo image around 200x60px with a transparent background
2. Save it as "logo.png" in this directory (/public/assets/images/logo.png)

Until a custom logo is uploaded, the application will use the fallback "C" logo component.

Notes:
- The logo should be designed to work well on both light and dark backgrounds
- The Logo component supports fallback, so if this file is missing, a placeholder will be displayed
- When uploading a custom logo via the UI, this file will be replaced with the uploaded logo
