# CompeteHQ Implementation Task

## Before proceeding:
1. Read and understand the CODEBASE_DOCUMENTATION.md file
2. Review the CompeteHQ architecture, component patterns, and UI design principles
3. Summarize your understanding of the task before implementation

## Task Overview
I need to implement [feature description].

## User Story
As a [coach/team admin/parent], I want to [action/capability] so that [benefit/outcome].

## Requirements (Priority: Must/Should/Nice)
- [MUST] The feature must [key requirement]
- [SHOULD] The feature should [secondary requirement]
- [NICE] The feature could [optional enhancement]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [specific, testable condition]
- [specific, testable condition]
- [specific, testable condition]

## Design Conformance
- Must follow CompeteHQ's clean, mobile-first design principles
- Must use existing Chakra UI components (especially Table/Card patterns as appropriate)
- Must maintain our royal blue (#10417A) brand identity
- Must be fully responsive for all device sizes
- Must consider on-field usage scenarios (sunlight visibility, one-handed operation)

## Technical Approach
- Should follow our React Context + Hooks pattern for state management
- Should use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Should follow our API-first architecture
- Should include appropriate error handling and loading states
- [any specific technical requirements]

## Key Files/Components
- Files that will need to be created: [file paths]
- Files that will need to be modified: [file paths]
- Existing components to reference: [component names]

## Integration Points
- Depends on [data models, APIs, or services]
- Will interact with [other components or features]
- Potential impact on [existing features]

## Performance Expectations
- Should render within 300ms on mobile devices
- Should minimize unnecessary re-renders and API calls
- Should handle typical team sizes (15-30 players)

## Deliverables
- Implemented feature with all must-have requirements
- Component documentation following project standards
- Basic test coverage for core functionality

## Implementation Plan
Before starting, please provide:
1. Your understanding of the task and approach
2. Any clarifying questions about requirements
3. A brief implementation plan listing components to create/modify

After implementation:
1. Summary of what was implemented
2. List of files modified
3. Instructions for testing

## Additional Context
[Any specific design references, mockups, or existing examples to follow]
