# Chakra UI Optimization

This directory contains enhanced Chakra UI components that:

1. Add additional functionality to base components
2. Maintain consistent styling across the application
3. Work with our bundle optimization strategy

## Bundle Size Optimization

Instead of modifying imports in every file (which would be error-prone and time-consuming), we've taken a different approach to reduce Chakra UI's bundle size:

### 1. Webpack Optimization

We've configured webpack in the Next.js config to:

- **Chunk Splitting**: Create separate chunks for Chakra UI components
- **Code Minification**: Optimize Chakra code with advanced Terser options
- **Tree Shaking**: Enable proper tree shaking for Chakra components

### 2. Component Usage Optimization

- Use the `shouldForwardProp` pattern for styled components
- Memoize components that render frequently
- Use optimized rendering patterns in list components

### 3. Theme Configuration

- Only include the components and variants we actually use
- Optimize color scales by removing unused values
- Configure default props to reduce redundant prop declarations

## Enhanced Components

Our custom components provide additional functionality that simplifies usage:

- **Button**: Enhanced with consistent styling and additional variants
- **Input**: Combines input, label, and error handling in one component
- **Select**: Adds option management and simplified API
- **FormGroup**: Standardizes form layouts and spacing

## Performance Best Practices

1. **Avoid Nested Theme Providers**: Use a single theme provider at the top level
2. **Memoize Heavy Components**: Use React.memo for components that render often
3. **Lazy Load Features**: Only load heavy components when needed

By following these strategies, we achieve a smaller bundle size without having to change imports throughout the codebase.
